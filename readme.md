# Math App
This project is still in its mvp phase, which is: 
> A simple mobile application that prints an equation, and lets the user answer. The equation, answer and time it took to solve it is persisted. 


## Known issues
- The equation will always nest the the items, resulting in: 12/(4+2)=2 and never 12/4+2=7
- Divisions by 0 are possible
- Divisions can become really big Example: 119 / (8 + 9)
- I can press play to play the audio
- Auto migrate does not work
